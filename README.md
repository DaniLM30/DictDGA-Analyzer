# DictDGA-Analyzer
This repository contains a Python script to extract the used dictionary to create the AGDs generated by a Dict-DGA algorithm and a Python Notebook to create a co-occurrence matrix of words

## Dictionary Extraction Python Script
This script uses the **WordSegment** module created by Grant Jenks based on code from the chapter “Natural Language Corpus Data” by Peter Norvig from the book “Beautiful Data” (Segaran and Hammerbacher, 2009).
This module's installation instructions can be found here:

This script reads the malware samples from the **dga_testing.txt file.**

## Words Co-occurrence Matrix Notebook
This Notebook contains the necessary code to generate a word co-occurrence matrix of the available words in the AGDs contained in the **dga_testing.txt** file.
It also has the necessary code to filter those cells in the matrix with a certain co-occurrence index.
